**Mentors:** Yali Wang, Arghya Kusum Das  
**Applicant:** Salvatore — Mathematical Engineering, Intern and Master's Thesis Researcher in Deep Learning University of Naples Federico II

---

A hybrid deep learning pipeline for predicting wildfire risk in interior Alaska using multi-modal satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 optical), ERA5 climate reanalysis data, and MTBS fire perimeters as ground truth.

> **Key Result:** SpatialCNN trained on real Sentinel-1 SAR + dNBR data achieves **AUC-ROC 0.983** and **97% fire recall** on spatially-independent test tiles from the 2022 Alaska fire season.

## Results

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| AUC-ROC | **0.983** | Near-perfect fire/no-fire discrimination |
| Fire Recall | **97%** | Only 1 of 38 fire tiles missed |
| Fire Precision | 25% | Conservative — flags extra areas (desirable for early warning) |
| Accuracy | 77.6% | Strong given 4.7% fire base rate |
| Dataset | 2,460 tiles | 64×64 px, 7 channels, spatial block split |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run demo (no data download needed)

```bash
python src/demo_pipeline.py
```

Trains Random Forest + Gradient Boosting on synthetic wildfire features. Outputs feature importance, evaluation plots, and a risk map to `outputs/`.

### 3. Download real satellite data

```bash
# Authenticate with Google Earth Engine
earthengine authenticate

# Export satellite imagery to Google Drive
python src/data_acquisition.py
```

This submits 8 export tasks to GEE (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, dNBR, fire labels, terrain, landcover) for the interior Alaska study area. Monitor progress at [code.earthengine.google.com/tasks](https://code.earthengine.google.com/tasks). Download completed GeoTIFFs from Google Drive → `wildfire_data/` folder into `data/raw/`.

### 4. Download ERA5 weather data

```bash
python src/data_acquisition.py  # ERA5 section downloads via CDS API
python extract_era5.py          # Unzip the downloaded files
python src/explore_era5.py      # Visualize fire season weather
```

Requires a [CDS API key](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). Downloads 6-hourly reanalysis for April–September 2022 (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, soil moisture).

### 5. Preprocess and train

```bash
# Preprocess real GeoTIFFs into 64×64 tiles
python src/preprocess_real_data.py

# Train deep learning models on real data
python train_real.py
```

### 6. Launch GIS dashboard

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard.py
```

## Models

### SpatialCNN (Baseline) — Current Best

4 convolutional blocks (32→64→128→256), BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool, global average pooling, 2 FC layers. Trained with Focal Loss (γ=2) for class imbalance. **424K parameters.**

### CNN-LSTM (Primary — In Development)

Shared CNN encoder extracts spatial features per timestep → bidirectional LSTM captures temporal trends (6-month lookback) → fused with ERA5 weather time-series → 3-class risk output (High / Moderate / No Risk).

### WildfireTransformer

Vision Transformer with 8×8 patch embedding, learnable positional encoding, 4-layer encoder (4 heads, 128-dim). Comparison architecture for capturing long-range spatial dependencies.

## Study Area

- **Region:** Interior Alaska — Fairbanks
- **Coordinates:** 63.5°N – 64.5°N, 150.5°W – 149.0°W
- **Fire Year:** 2022 (3M+ acres burned statewide)
- **Projection:** EPSG:3338 (Alaska Albers Equal Area)

## Key Design Decisions

- **Spatial block cross-validation** (5×5 grid) prevents autocorrelation leakage between train/test sets
- **Focal Loss** addresses extreme class imbalance (fires are <5% of tiles)
- **SAR as primary input** — Sentinel-1 penetrates cloud cover, which obscures 40–60% of optical scenes over Alaska
- **Percentile normalization** (2nd–98th) handles outliers in SAR backscatter and burn severity indices
- **Multi-resolution fusion** — all sources reprojected to 30m common grid; ERA5 weather attached as tile-level temporal features

## ERA5 Fire Season Analysis (2022)

| Variable | Mean | Max | Min |
|----------|------|-----|-----|
| Temperature | 8.2°C | 29.5°C | -22.6°C |
| Wind Speed | 2.1 m/s | 8.8 m/s | — |
| Soil Moisture | 0.307 m³/m³ | — | 0.032 m³/m³ |

Peak fire conditions occurred in July–August with sustained high temperatures, low humidity, and declining soil moisture.
